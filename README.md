# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Installation

You can run the Game on it's [GitHub Page](https://alenaats.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone/) or simply by downloading ZIP archive with the project and opening index.html file in your browser.

## Basic Rules

Use arrow keys to move the player on the board. Once the player reaches the water the game is won. After the alert message is closed the player gets back to its start position. Once the player collides with the bug the game is lost and the player gets back to its start position.
